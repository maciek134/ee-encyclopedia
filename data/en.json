It was soon realized that lack of experience in capital ship warfare had left fleet doctrines lagging behind the tactics of Capsuleers fighting in the Outer Regions. From this realization was born the concept of the Force Auxiliary capital ship, a vessel dedicated to ensuring the survival of more combat- and command-oriented capital ships such as Carriers and Titans. The Apostle-class Force Auxiliary was commissioned in memory of Empress Jamyl I and is richly decorated in token of this dedication.","1261":"\"Hyperoxidation\" was the term given to the process of rapidly fossilizing the carbon structures, readily available in the form of biomass, which forms the basic framework of supertensile plastics.

In large part this was due to a flaring up of the old debate between the firepower- and maneuver-oriented generals of the Brutor dominated military circles and the logistics- and fighter-oriented Sebiestor fleet tactician and technologist circles.\n\nAfter much chest-beating, and due in no small part to the intervention of Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor, the arguments of the Sebiestor won out and the Lif-class Force Auxiliary was commissioned over the objections of the Brutor military elite.","1271":"\"Sparkly\" Carola","1272":"The Revelation represents the pinnacle of Amarrian military technology.

Over time these storms will generally scorch the surface rock black, adding to the visual impact.","1274":"\"It is imperative that our Federation Navy capital ship fleets remain a match for any threat that may be posed by hostile entities or aggressive powers.

The military-industrial complex of the Federation was more than equal to the task of implementing the necessary changes to existing designs in line with the concepts inspired by Capsuleer capital warfare practice. \n\nThe Federal Intelligence Office additionally recommended that the Gallente build a Force Auxiliary capital of their own to maintain parity with the Amarr-Caldari alliance.

The effort was not without benefit though, as part of their work focused on reducing the Nestor's mass enough that it could make its way into unexplored territories that might've been hazardous to bulkier vessels. This paid off by affording the Nestor unmatched access to wormhole space, and meant that the embedded miniature rescue vessel on the ship's hull could be relegated to a decommissioned role. With covert function off the table, the Sanctuary turned their eyes on logistics and now the Nestor serves as one of the best support platforms in New Eden.","5956":"This was one of the first vessels the Sisters of EVE made available to Capsuleers.

This revolt, while precipitating the almost total annihilation of the Starkmanir Minmatar tribe, has in historical retrospect come to be credited as one of the seminal events leading to the later Minmatar uprising. The weapon itself is a three-foot rod with a spiked solar disc on the top, the design of the original relic believed to date back to the pre-Reclaiming era of Amarrian prophet Dano Geinok. It isn't believed to have been intended as a weapon originally, but as a rod of command for high-ranking members of the Amarrian Conformist clergy.","16688":"This cord of yellowish fangs is typical of many with a claimed history of being the spoils from raids on Amarr slave camps, the story going that the necklace is formed of teeth from the Slaver Hounds killed during such raids. Far from the effects of decay, the teeth have not fared well since parting with their owner. A scattering of little notch marks suggests they were forcibly removed – perhaps hurriedly or the creature they came from was in its death throes at the time. (The idea that anyone would try to remove the teeth from a Slaver Hound short of being mortally wounded seems far-fetched.) The varying sizes of the teeth offer little clue to whether they came from one creature or many. However, their immense length, some as long as 7 centimeters, does indeed point to the Amarr slaveholders' favored Syrikos Hound as a likely source.","16690":"Number Box","16692":"Written by Heideran VII, the Amarr Emperor himself, Pax Amarria is the most remarkable book published in the last century.

Tools like the ci'nal were used by northern Sebiestor clans to break apart ice, though only a few clans still use them since the development of high-tech cutters and refrigeration units. Kri'taks retain the stiletto shape of the original ci'nal, but their blade is broadened and edged. Kri'taks have become a standard weapon for Valklear Special Forces.

More complex variants have lights or chemicals inset in the material that can make the clackers do anything from reflecting light to taking on an eerie glow, or even emitting sparks. It's not at all uncommon for older siblings to frighten their younger relatives by sneaking up on them at night and rattling a clacker, giving off the impression that they're some sort of red-eyed children-eating mythical beast snapping away it's jaws, ready for its next meal.","16706":"From what little is decipherable, Viriette seems to be advising Serpentis Inquest scientists on various methods of production efficiency, all of which appear to be applied to the manufacture of Drop boosters.

It also contains a decent amount of pyerite.\n\nAvailable primarily in 0.0 security status solar systems or lower.","16929":"In AD23146, Quafe – EVE Online's own soda pop – was born. It quickly became the most popular soft drink in the universe, manufactured by a Gallentean company bearing the same name. Like so many soft drinks, it was initially intended as a medicine for indigestion and tender stomachs, but the refreshing effects of the drink appealed to everyone and the drink quickly became tremendously popular. Quafe is one of the best recognized brands in the whole EVE universe thanks to the immense popularity of its products. It's also the only company that has the right to operate on its own in the Caldari State. Rumors abound regarding the popular drink – some claim that Quafe is made from reprocessing dead Capsuleers. Still others believe that carrying a can of Quafe on board a ship can reduce the possibility of being targeted.","16930":"Azure plagioclase was made infamous in the melancholic song prose Miner Blues by the Gallentean folk singer Jaroud Dertier three decades ago.\n\nPlagioclase is not amongst the most valuable ore types around, but it contains a large amount of pyerite and is thus always in constant demand.
